**Business Recommendations:**

Data-Backed Recommendations --> 

1. Expand Older TV Show Portfolio
Quantifiable Insight: Compared to movies, the median release date for television series is a little older. By the year 2000, only a small percentage of the available television programmes had been released.
Recommendation: To attract a wider age group, including older adults who may have fond memories of old series, Netflix could consider adding more classic TV shows to its catalogue in the light of this focus on new television programmes.

2. Regional Customization
Quantifiable Insight: Nearly 50% of the entire Netflix catalogue is made up of content originating in the US, India and UK.
Recommendation: With content from 748 different country combinations available, Netflix has the opportunity to further customize its offering on the basis of regional popularity. This could lead to an increase in local subscriptions and customer satisfaction.

3. Explore Underrepresented Genres and Ratings
Quantifiable Insight: Ratings ‘TV-MA’ and ‘TV-14’ account for 61.2% of all content. There are fewer genres in the catalogue, such as documentary films and children’s movies.
Recommendation: To attract a more diverse audience, Netflix could broaden its portfolio by examining lesser known genres and television ratings.

4. Seasonal Releases
Quantifiable Insight: There is a noticeable spike in the number of TV shows added during July, December and January, suggesting these are peak months for new releases.
Recommendation: Given this seasonal trend, Netflix could focus on releasing highly anticipated new seasons or exclusive content during these months to capitalize on increased viewership.

5.Country specific insights
- In most countries, except the US, very limited genres are targeted. The current available genres seem to be best suited to the US and a few countries, but there is a need for more genres that are popular in the region. For example: Indian Mythological content is highly popular. Netflix can create such more country specific genres and it might also be liked acorss the world just like Japanese Anime and Korean TV shows.
- The content need to be targetting the demographic of any country. Netflix can produce higher number of content in the perticular rating as per demographic of the country. For example: Country like India , which is highly populous , has maximum content available only in three rating TV-MA, TV-14 , TV-PG. It is unlikely to serve below 14 age and above 35 year age group. This demographic barrier can be broken if Netflix adds more and more content suitable for majority of the age groups.
